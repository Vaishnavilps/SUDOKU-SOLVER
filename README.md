# SUDOKU-SOLVER
This is a python program to solve sudoku.
This program solves Sudoku puzzles using the backtracking algorithm and recursion. Sudoku is a popular number puzzle game where the objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.

The backtracking algorithm is a brute-force technique that systematically tries different possibilities until a valid solution is found. It starts by selecting an empty cell and tries all possible numbers from 1 to 9. If a number is valid, it moves to the next empty cell and repeats the process. If none of the numbers are valid, it backtracks to the previous cell and tries a different number. Recursion is used to handle the iterative exploration of possible solutions.
